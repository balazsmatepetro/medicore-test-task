# Medicore Test Task

## Requirements

At Medicore we encourage a healthy lifestyle, therefore we encourage our employees to come to work by bike. If you would commute by bike you will get a compensation of € 0,50 per km per day. For distances between 5 to 10 km the compensation will even double! However, for distances over 10 km employees prefer a different way of commuting.

Some employees commute by bus or train, for which the compensation is € 0,25 per km per day. If you would commute by car the compensation would be € 0,10 per km per day.

Compensation is paid on a monthly basis on each first Monday of the next month. Employees work 5 days a week.

| Employee | Transport | Distance (km/one way) |

| Martin   | Bus       | 8                     |

Create a small application which provides our HR department with a monthly overview of the compensation per employee for 2017. The output of the application should be a CSV file which should contain the following columns; employee, transport, traveled distance, compensation for the entire month and the payment date.
